# jQuery

[jQuery] has quickly become the defacto standard for general cross-browser JavaScript development.


### Underscore.js -- For those familiar with Prototype.js

[Underscore] is a 3rd party library accessed through, what else, the `_` variable.  This can be a very useful tool as it provides utility methods such as: `map`, `reduce`, `first`, `last`, etc.  _jQuery_ only includes `each` and `map`, so if you are used to a programming style that commonly uses these methods, such as the one _Prototype.js_ encourages, this will be a handy addition.
