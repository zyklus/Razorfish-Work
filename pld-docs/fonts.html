<p>Recent advances in web-font technologies now enable us to use nearly any desired font on a webpage, something that until recently has been reserved for print media.</p>

<p>Before doing so, however, general design practices of minimizing the total number of font variations on a page/site should be followed.</p>

<h3>Licensing Issues</h3>

<p>There are sometimes licensing issues around distributing fonts to a browser.  It is not the purpose of this document to get into these issues, but be aware that there are such issues if you plan to use custom fonts and to distribute font files.</p>

<h3>Methods of Font Distribution</h3>

<p>Below are a few of the various services that provide cross-browser font rendering.  Older techniques such as image or flash replacement can be ignored at this point and should be considered deprecated (except when licensing issues are involved).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a> - Simple, easy to use.  Simply include a link to a <code>css</code> file and you are good to go.  The only downside is that you must choose from their list of fonts.  If you want to use a custom font that is not yet in their directory, you must use one of the options below.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fontface/generator">Font Squirrel</a> is a site that allows you to convert a font into various formats for use in various browsers.  This is the same method that the other services on this list use, but you are responsible for hosting the files and (possibly) more legally responsible for licensing violations.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.typekit.com/">Typekit</a> and <a href="http://www.webtype.com/">Web Type</a> are both 3rd party services that host font files similar to <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Google Web Fonts</a>.  They both have subscription fees.</p>
