technology firms, Razorfish is more capable at combining people who have a deep
understanding of experience design and technologies with those who are steeped
in traditional marketing. We combine a digital heritage with big idea thinking,
and are able to execute at the most granular, tactical level. This means we can
create seamlessly integrated, end-to-end digital solutions that will transform
your businesses.

engines. In a highly competitive/low engagement category, Razorfish led the
digital launch of Bing. Our first challenge was to create the brand identity.

and when to use Bing."

Nike own the conversation, without having to own the sponsorship. Razorfish
planned, negotiated, and implemented a first-of-its-kind global media effort on
three platforms: Facebook, YouTube, XBOX. We took Nike's exciting three minute
"Write the Future" video and seeded it to influencers to fuel the conversation
during the World Cup. Soccer fans on our global social platform increased from
1MM to more than 3MM. Nike had twice as many references related to the World
Cup versus the official sponsor Adidas. And the "Write the Future" video broke
YouTube's global advertising record for the biggest audience.

brand had lost relevance for adult women, there was little brand engagement
beyond the brick-and-mortar, product-focused approach the brand had pursued
through the traditional 30-second spot. We gave Barbie a voice for the first
time in 50 years via creative executions which allowed Barbie to speak directly
