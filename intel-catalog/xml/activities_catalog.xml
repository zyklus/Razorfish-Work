		<li>Requirements regarding other brand elements do not apply to landing pages</li>
		<li>Some activities are subject to spending limits. Your budget for these activities will be displayed in your account summary. Check the View Spending Limit Funds page to make sure funds are available before performing such activities. Keep in mind that funds are shown as available until Reimbursement Requests are submitted.</li></ul>
		</p>

		<ul><li>Cash Prizes</li>

		[[image]]
		<h4>Balanced Branding</h4>

		<h4>Joint Promotion</h4>
		<p>Marketing activities must promote a Memberís Eligible Product, a solution based an Eligible Product, or an initiative.</p>
		[[image]]
		<p>Solutions are defined as a combination of hardware software and/or services. Examples can be virtualization, cloud computing, etc.</p>
		<p>Initiatives are defined as non-product focused activities positioning you and Intel as technology leaders. Examples can span from music to art to sport to scientific research.</p>
		<p>The <a href=""><![CDATA[Program Calendar</a> identifies Eligible Brands and their respective reimbursement rates.</p>
		<h5>Product Activites</h5>
		<p>Is your activity promoting a product? Make sure to use:
		  <ul><li>the appropriate Eligible processor logo - [[show the badges!]]</li>
		  <li>the appropriate Intel Mention for a processor (i.e. Intel(r) Core(tm) i5 processor) or a family (i.e. Intel(r) Core processors or Intel(r) Core family)</li></ul></p>
		<p>Alernative Intel Mentions for each processor brand will be available in the Brand Resource Center.</p>
		<p>If the Intel Mention is not included in the headline, subhead or body copy of a marketing activity and is included in the specification list instead, it must be the first item on that list.</p>
		<p>If an activity features multiple products, the Eligible Product(s) must occupy at least 50% of visual space or airtime.</p>
		[[image]]
		<p>For activities promoting Member product lines not entirely based on Intel processors, the exact sub-brand, model number, or SKU of the Intel-based product must be identified.</p>
		<h5>Solution or Initiative Activites</h5>
		<p>Is your activity promoting a solution or an initiative? (Note: if a product is mentioned either visually or in text, then Product Activity requirements apply.)
		<p>If no product is mentioned either visually or in text, then you may choose to use:
		  <ul><li>the Intel Masterbrand Mark</li>
		  <li><b>Intel(r)</b> after your company name (this qualifies as the Intel Mention)</li></ul></p>
		[[image]]
		<h4>Shortened Intel Mentions</h4>
		<p>Shortened Intel Mentions are allowed in certain activities and vary according to the processor featured.</p>
		<h5>Guidance for IntelÆ Coreô Processors and Intel(r) Atom(tm) Processors</h5>
		<p>A shortened Intel Mention is available for use in online text ads only if the full Intel Mention appears on the ad's landing page. No other shortened use is allowed.</p>
		<h5>Guidance for Other IntelÆ Processors</h5>
		<p>A shortened Intel Mention is optional for use in print headlines, TV, radio, online banner and text ads. The full Intel Mention must appear on the ad's landing page. No other shortened use is allowed.</p>
		<p>To create a shortened brand name, copy the approved Intel Mention from Brand Resource Center and remove the noun corresponding to the English word processor.</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Balanced Branding</h4>
		<p>Marketing activities must represent the Memberís brand and Intelís brand in a balanced manner.</p>
		<p>For logos this means:
		  <ul><li>The area of your largest logo must be comparable to the area dedicated to the Intel logo. An online tool will be available for you to ensure this criteria is met.</li>
		  <li>If you choose to omit your logo from a marketing activity, Intel branding requirements still apply. A minimum size will be provided for each Intel logo.</li></ul></p>
		<p>For Intel Mentions this means:
		  <ul><li>Intel should be mentioned in the same font size as other body copy or at the same volume and speed as the rest of the audio</li>
		  <li>If an activity does not support graphics, a logo is not reauired, and only an Intel Mention is required</li>
		  <li>If an activity does not support text, an audio Intel Mention is required</li></ul></p>
		  <br>
		<h4>Other Brand Elements</h4>
		<p>Marketing activities may include other Brand Elements. Reimbursement percentage may vary based on their quantity, size, and use of a Top 20 brand.</p>
		<p>Inclusion of other brand elements is allowed but reimbursement may vary:
		  <ul><li>Inclusion of three or more non-Top 20 brands* will result in 25% reimbursement</li>
		  <li>Inclusion of  one of a Top 20 brand will result in 25% reimbursement</li>
		  <li>Inclusion of more than one Top 20 brands will result in no reimbursement</li>
		  <li>Inclusion of the below brand elements wonít impact reimbursement:
			<ul><li>Other Intel processor brands</li>
			<li>Intel-based products/technologies</li>
			<li>Industry standard logos</li>
			<li>Distribution channel logos</li>
			<li>Payment method logos</li>
			<li>Images of or from a movie or game (even if they belong to one of the Top 20 brands)</li>
			<li>Up to two non-Top 20 global brands</li></ul>
		  </li></ul>
		  *as defined by the INTERBRAND TOP GLOBAL BRAND CHART 
		</p>
		<p>All other brand elements should be smaller than the Intel logo, with the exception of: 
		  <ul><li>Sales partner logos in sales partner activities</li>
		  <li>Logos of a third party organizer of an initiative (i.e. the Olympic Games)</li>
		  <li>Images of or from a movie or game (even if they belong to one of the Top 20 brands)</li></ul></p>
		[[insert chart]]
		<br>
		<h4>Competition Inclusion</h4>
		<p>In many activities competition inclusion is allowed and will have an impact on reimbursement. Competition logo may not be larger than the Intel logo in the activity.</p>
		<p>Specific details are provided on each activity type page.</p>]]>

	  <page id="sales_partner"><![CDATA[
		<h4>Co-Branding Through Sales Partners</h4>
		<p>The Intel Inside Program offers you a wide range of activities to enable you go to market through your sales partners.</p>
		
		<p>Sales Partners are third-party distribution channels that sell Member products to end users on behalf of the Member. Examples of Sales Partners include: retailers, e-tailers, telcos, resellers, and distributors. These activities are reimbursed according to rate cards created by an independent media auditor to reflect market prices. Rate cards will be phased in. If the activity runs in a location not covered by a rate card, standard documentation requirements apply (documentation must be provided by a third party).</p>
		[[rate cards phases image]]
		<p>The following conditions apply to sales partner activities:
		  <ul><li>Member must engage and agree upon the activity with the sales partner</li>
		  <li>Sales partner executes the activity</li>
		  <li>Member is respponsible to ensure that the activity meets Program requirements</li>
		  <li>Member is responsible for requesting reimbursement and for retaining documentation</li>
		  <li>Intel will only reimburse Members, not sales partners</li></ul></p>
		<br>
		   <h4>Clip and Pay (United States and Canada only)</h4>
		   <p>The Clip and Pay reimbursement model allows Members to be reimbursed without submitting reimbursement requests. This model is available only in the United States and Canada for Sales Partner flyers and catalogs distributed as inserts/outserts and for Sales Partner newspaper and magazine ads.</p>
		<h4>Specific Branding Requirements</h4>
		<p>To properly support sales partner activities we introduced two additional concepts:
		  <ol><li>Sales partner logo may be larger than the Intel logo in the activity</li>
		  <li>The following sales partner activities are reimbursed on eligible area. In this case a minimum size Intel logo is required:
			<ul><li>Flyers &amp; e-Flyers</li>
			<li>Catalogs &amp; e-Catalogs</li>
			<li>Newspaper</li>
			<li>Magazine</li>
			<li>E-mail Marketing</li></ul>
		  </li></ol>
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Eligible Area</h4>
		<p>Certain sales partner activities feature multiple Member products on the same page. In order to support these activity types, the program allows reimbursement for parts of pages by defining an eligible area.</p>
		<p>Eligible Area is defined as the area within an advertisement, delineated by column rules, clear space and/or color, which contains only Member devices or solutions, proper supporting content, and Intel brand elements.</p>
		<p>On those activities reimbursed on eligible area, a reimbursement request may be submitted for a full page if the following requirements are met:
		  <ol><li>Only one Member's products are featured on the page.</li>
		  <li>The page does not feature any competitive products.</li>
		  <li>If multiple products are featured, the eligible product must occupy at least 50% of the page, or all products featured are eligible products.</li></ol>
