		<strong>Purchase &amp; Accrue</strong>
	</p>
	<p>As with today’s program, to accrue co-branding funds you will need to purchase specific processors from Intel and integrate them into your systems. Remember to save documentation related to processor integration rate for 18 months</p>
	<p>Also, remember that purchases made after October 2nd, 2011 will accrue at the new rate of 2.5%</p>
	<p>The new system tools will allow you to easily review:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Which processors accrue funds</li>
		<li>Accrual balances</li>
		<li>Any potential fund expirations (note: as with today’s program funds will expire after one year)</li>
	</ul>
