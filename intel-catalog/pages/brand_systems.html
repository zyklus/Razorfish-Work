		<strong>Brand Systems</strong>
	</p>
	<p>As with today, all Intel-based systems must be branded. Weâ€™ve reduced the number of the label sizes from twelve to four (please see page 9). The system branding must be visible when the device is in use.</p>
	<p>More information on label options to be announced in the November communications!</p>
